We've dropped this alpha release to show the proof of concept for fast easy web based 3D. A lot will change for the beta adding awesomeness such as:

+ Auto complilation and tree-shaking of your code
+ multi canvas support at 90FPS
+ Adapters for all the major 3D export files
+ Instant VR setup
+ Cleaner code
